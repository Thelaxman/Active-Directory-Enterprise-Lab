# üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory Enterprise Lab

## üìå Overview
This project simulates a **corporate-grade Active Directory environment** built on Windows Server 2019.  
It includes multi-domain controllers, DNS/DHCP integration, security policies, and PowerShell automation.  
The goal was to design, deploy, and manage a secure, scalable directory service similar to what is used in enterprise IT environments.
